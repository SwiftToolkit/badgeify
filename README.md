# Badgeify

This is the final sample project of the post [Using SwiftUI in Command Line Tools](https://SwiftToolkit.dev/swiftui-meets-command-line), at SwiftToolkit.dev.

The example app icon used in this project is from the NetNewsWire app.

# Usage

To use this tool, first clone this project. Then, in the root directory, use SPM to build and run the executable:

```sh
swift run badgeify --input icon.png --output badged.png --text "Some Text"
```

Where instead of `icon.png` you can use any path.
